# Text2RPG
A text-based game generator

## Potential Ideas:
* Read in text files describing details of games in special format
* Random Room Path Generation
* Stats
* Fighting
* Multiplayer?: Server Hosting vs Database Storing
*     Issue: how do you verify that the other person is playing the same game; remember that this should be cross platform
